can you help me figure out why my program is printing the performanceMessage twice, and one is incorrect? 

program: 
package guessingGame;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class GuessNumberApp {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        Game game = new Game();
        game.displayWelcomeMessage();

        String playAgain;
        do {
            game.generateNumberToBeGuessed();
            game.displayPleaseGuessMessage();

            boolean correctGuess = false;
            while (!correctGuess) {
                System.out.print("Enter your guess: ");
                int guess = scanner.nextInt();
                game.makeGuess(guess);
                correctGuess = game.isCorrectGuess();
                if (correctGuess) {
                    game.displayCorrectGuessMessage();
                    game.displayPerformanceMessage();
                } else {
                    game.displayGuessAgainMessage();
                }
            }

            System.out.print("Do you want to play again? (y/n): ");
            playAgain = scanner.next();
        } while (playAgain.equalsIgnoreCase("y"));

        scanner.close();
    }
}

Game class:

package guessingGame;
import java.util.Random;

public class Game {

 	private int number;
    private int guessNumber;
    private int counter;

    public Game() {
        generateNumberToBeGuessed();
        counter = 0;
    }

    public void generateNumberToBeGuessed() {
        Random rand = new Random();
        number = rand.nextInt(100) + 1;
    }

    public void makeGuess(int guessNumber) {
        this.guessNumber = guessNumber;

    }

    public boolean isCorrectGuess() {
        return guessNumber == number;
    }

    public void displayWelcomeMessage() {
        System.out.println("Welcome to the Guessing Game!");
    }

    public void displayPleaseGuessMessage() {
        System.out.println("Please guess a number between 1 and 100:");
    }

    public void displayCorrectGuessMessage() {
        System.out.println("Congratulations! You guessed the correct number.");
        displayPerformanceMessage();  
        counter = 0;

    }

    public void displayGuessAgainMessage() {
        if (guessNumber > number + 10) {
            System.out.println("Way too high! Guess again.");
            counter = counter + 1;
        } else if (guessNumber > number) {
            System.out.println("Too high! Guess again.");
            counter = counter + 1;
        } else if (guessNumber < number - 10) {
            System.out.println("Way too low! Guess again.");
            counter = counter + 1;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Too low! Guess again.");
            counter = counter + 1;
        }
        System.out.printf(counter + "\n");
    }

    public void displayPerformanceMessage() {
        if (counter <= 3) {
            System.out.println("Great work! You are a mathematical wizard.");
            
        } else if (counter <= 7) {
            System.out.println("Not too bad! You've got some potential.");
            
        } else {
            System.out.println("What took you so long?");
        }
    }
}
